Showcasing current knowledge and aptitude

This repository contain several examples of my learning projects.
I'm an aspiring software developer that has been tinkering with code since 2010.
I became a student of Computer Science at Oregon State University in Winter 2013,
and I hope to graduate in 1 to 2 years from now, summer 2015.
