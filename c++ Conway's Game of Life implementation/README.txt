NOTE: Please use "make all" to compile ("make" does not work
with line 129: exit(1) in main.cpp).

Update: #include <cstdlib> added to main.cpp
	so that "make" can now be used to
	compile the program.  It was originally 
	developed and tested in Ubuntu virtual machine
	but recompiled and run in Cygwin environment 
	for the demo video.

	generation.cpp and generation.hpp are not 
	included here on Github because they are older,
	incomplete versions of the "copies" (This was
	before I got my feet wet with Git source control.)
