This is how the beginning of everything happened. God created the universe and everything in it in six days. At first, the earth was dark and empty, and nothing had been formed in it. But God's Spirit was there over the water.

Then God spoke and said, "Let there be light!" And there was light. God saw that the light was good and called it "day." He separated it from the darkness, which He called "night." God created the light on the first day of creation.

On the second day of creation, God spoke and created the sky above the earth.

On the third day, God spoke and separated the water from the dry land. He called the dry land "earth," and He called the water "seas."
