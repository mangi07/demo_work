====== 3. The Flood ======

{{:en:obs:obs-03-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

God told Noah to make the boat about 140 meters long, 23 meters wide, and 13.5 meters high. It was to be made of wood and have three levels, many rooms, a roof, and a window. The boat would keep Noah, his family, and two of every kind of animal safe during the flood.

Noah obeyed God. He and his three sons built the boat just the way God had told them. It took many years to build the boat, because it was so big. Noah warned the people about the coming flood and told them to turn to God, but they just laughed at him.

Noah and his family also gathered enough food for themselves and the animals. When everything was ready, God told Noah it was time for him, his wife, his three sons, and their wives to get into the boatâ€”eight people in all.
